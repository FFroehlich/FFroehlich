# About Me

I am a Early Career Group Leader at the [Francis Crick Instute](https://www.crick.ac.uk), where I head the [Dynamics of Living Systems](www.frohlichlab.com/) (https://github.com/frohlich-lab). For more information, you can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fabfrohlich) or read my [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pGYETGQAAAAJ&hl=en).

# Estimation Pipeline

Over the years, I have developed and contributed to several toolboxes that permit the efficient formulation, simulation and calibration of kinetic models of cellular signaling. All toolboxes are modular and interoperable, allowing the flexible definition of customizable analysis pipelines.

- Formulate your model using [pysb](https://github.com/pysb/pysb)
- Define your estimation problem using [PEtab](https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab)
- Solve your estimation problem using [pyPESTO](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO)
- Use the efficient optimizers implemented in [fides](https://github.com/fides-dev/fides)
- Use the scalable simulate and sensitivity computation methods implemented in [AMICI](https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI)
