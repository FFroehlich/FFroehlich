# About Me

I am a [HFSP](https://www.hfsp.org) Postdoctoral Fellow in [Peter Sorger's group](https://sorger.med.harvard.edu) in the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu). I am developing methods to construct, calibrate and understand large kinetic models with hundreds to thousands of state variables and parameters. I apply these methods to study adaptive resistance in melanoma, where I integrate structural, molecular and omics data to build detailed mechanistic models for precision medicine applications.

# Estimation Pipeline

Over the years, I have developed and contributed to several toolboxes that permit the efficient formulation, simulation and calibration of kinetic models of cellular signaling. All toolboxes are modular and interoperable, allowing the flexible definition of customizable analysis pipelines.

- Formulate your model using [pysb](https://github.com/pysb/pysb)
- Define your estimation problem using [PEtab](https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab)
- Solve your estimation problem using [pyPESTO](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO)
- Use the efficient optimizers implemented in [fides](https://github.com/fides-dev/fides)
- Use the scalable simulate and sensitivity computation methods implemented in [AMICI](https://github.com/AMICI-dev/AMICI)
